âœ… Completed:
1. Email Analyzer Component
   - Implemented EmailAnalyzer class
   - Added Claude AI integration
   - Created comprehensive test suite
   - Handles email categorization (important, tech/ai, non-essential)
   - Generates summaries for tech/ai content
   - Error handling for API issues

ðŸš§ In Progress / To Do:

1. Database Layer (High Priority)
   - Implement database connection management
   - Create tables for deleted_emails and tech_content
   - Add methods for storing email metadata and content
   - Add transaction handling
   - Write tests for database operations

2. Gmail Service (High Priority)
   - Complete Gmail API authentication
   - Implement methods for:
     - Fetching unread emails
     - Moving emails to trash
     - Marking emails as read
   - Add retry logic for API rate limits
   - Write tests for Gmail operations

3. Main Email Manager (Medium Priority)
   - Implement main processing loop
   - Add orchestration between components
   - Handle error cases and retries
   - Implement waiting/backoff strategy
   - Write integration tests

4. Configuration & Setup (Low Priority)
   - Create configuration management
   - Add environment variable handling
   - Create setup/installation documentation
   - Add logging configuration
   - Create example .env file

5. Documentation & Testing (Ongoing)
   - Add docstrings to all classes/methods
   - Create usage examples
   - Add system architecture diagram
   - Write end-to-end tests
   - Create deployment guide

Next Steps:
1. Focus on database implementation first - it's a dependency for both Gmail and Manager components
2. Then implement Gmail service to get the basic email operations working
3. Finally, tie everything together in the EmailManager class
